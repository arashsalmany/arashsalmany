- 👋 Hi, I’m @arashsalmany
- 👀 I’m a passionate researcher and enthusiast in the fields of Medical Genetics and Cytogenetics. My primary interests focus on exploring the intricate mechanisms of genetic diseases, uncovering the genetic foundations of rare disorders, and tackling the challenges posed by undiagnosed diseases.
With a deep curiosity for how genetic variations impact human health, I aim to understand the complex interplay between genes and disease, particularly in cases that remain elusive or undiagnosed. By leveraging the power of bioinformatics and advanced genomic tools, I strive to contribute to the development of more accurate diagnostic methods and novel therapeutic approaches.
I am driven to collaborate with like-minded professionals in uncovering genetic mysteries and improving healthcare outcomes for those affected by rare and complex diseases. Let's work together to advance the understanding of genetics and its role in human health.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my expertise by learning dry lab techniques, with a focus on utilizing bioinformatics tools and computational approaches to analyze genetic data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on experts im my field
